## My process

I based this on the [W3School How To - Collapsibles/Accordion](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) and fleshed it out from there.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Never did an accordion from scratch and the HTML, CSS, JS practice also came in handy. Took longer than what i would like tho...üòÖ 

### Continued development

I dont see too many room for improvements, this project was very straightfoward

### Useful resources

- [W3School How To - Collapsibles/Accordion](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) - This helped me a lot to get starting with how the accordion logic works.
